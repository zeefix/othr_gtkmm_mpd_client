    Creates a new ``AudioFile`` instance given a WAV/AIFF/FLAC audio file ``filename_or_fileobject``. Subclass of
    ``AudioSource``. If ``filename_or_fileobject`` is a string, then it is interpreted as a path to an audio file on
    the filesystem. Otherwise, ``filename_or_fileobject`` should be a file-like object such as ``io.BytesIO`` or similar.
    Note that functions that read from the audio (such as ``recognizer_instance.record`` or
    ``recognizer_instance.listen``) will move ahead in the stream. For example, if you execute `
    `recognizer_instance.record(audiofile_instance, duration=10)`` twice, the first time it will return the first
    10 seconds of audio, and the second time it will return the 10 seconds of audio right after that. This is always
    reset to the beginning when entering an ``AudioFile`` context. WAV files must be in PCM/LPCM format;
    WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE and compressed WAV are not supported and may result in undefined behaviour.
    Both AIFF and AIFF-C (compressed AIFF) formats are supported. FLAC files must be in native FLAC format;
    OGG-FLAC is not supported and may result in undefined behaviour.
